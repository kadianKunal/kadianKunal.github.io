            I really think this is a subject that everybody on Earth should be forced to learn about at gunpoint. 
            Everybody has to learn behavioral biology because we're being behavioral biologists every time we serve on a jury. Every time we vote whether or not money should be spent on solving some problem, whether it's a problem, and whether it's solvable or not.
            Every time we try to make sense of a family member sunk in depression. Are they having a biochemical disorder, or are they just indulging themselves? We're behavioral biologists all the time. So it's probably a good thing that we are informed ones. <br>
