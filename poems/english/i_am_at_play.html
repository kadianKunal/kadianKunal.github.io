        <h1>I'm at play</h1>
        <h3>Dhruv Bhatt</h3>

        <p>
            <br>
            If, suddenly, I were to come across <br>
            Someone on the way <br>
            And if they were to ask me <br>
            Softly, <br>
            "How are you doing today?" <br> 
            Then I would say, <br> 
            Nature is so bountiful <br>
            And like waves in the ocean <br> 
            I'm at play! <br>
            <br>
            My frayed pockets <br>
            I've stuffed <br>
            With bouncing, spilling <br>
            Waves of ecstasy <br>
            I may be alone, and yet I feel <br>
            I'm in a carnival all day <br>
            On a treasure chest <br>
            With no lock at all <br>
            My riches are plenty safe! <br>
            like waves in the ocean <br> 
            I'm at play! <br>
            <br>
            Water in the eyes comes and goes <br>
            But the moistness within never dries <br>
            The shore may keep accounts <br>
            Of less and more <br>
            The ocean doesn't bother about such scores <br> 
            The sun may rise and set everyday <br> 
            The sky over me is always the same <br> 
            Like waves in the ocean <br>
            I'm at play! <br> 
            <br>
        </p>

            Renowned Gujarati writer Dhruv Bhatt recounts the moment when this poem was born. 
            Once he was walking on a hot day in a poor rural belt in coastal Saurashtra. 
            From a distance he saw an old man wearing a tattered dhoti struggling to till a harsh, 
            rocky earth with a heavy plough, while the sun beat down mercilessly. 
            Feeling deeply sympathetic to the old man's plight, Dhruv Dada gently asked him as he passed by, 
            Dada, kem chhe? (How are you?) The old man lifted his face and flashing a beatific smile at Dhruv Dada crooned, 
            'I'm doing just great!' Utterly taken aback and brought face to face with his own assumptions, 
            in that moment a song took shape in his heart.
