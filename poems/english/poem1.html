            Science, as you know, my little one, is the study <br>
            of the nature and behaviour of the universe. <br>
            It’s based on observation, on experiment, and measurement, <br>
            and the formulation of laws to describe the facts revealed. <br>
            <br>
            In the old times, they say, the men came already fitted with brains <br>
            designed to follow flesh-beasts at a run, <br>
            to hurdle blindly into the unknown, <br>
            and then to find their way back home when lost <br>
            with a slain antelope to carry between them. <br>
            Or, on bad hunting days, nothing. <br>
            <br>
            The women, who did not need to run down prey, <br>
            had brains that spotted landmarks and made paths between them <br>
            left at the thorn bush and across the scree <br>
            and look down in the bole of the half-fallen tree, <br>
            because sometimes there are mushrooms. <br>
            <br>
            Before the flint club, or flint butcher’s tools, <br>
            The first tool of all was a sling for the baby <br>
            to keep our hands free <br>
            and something to put the berries and the mushrooms in, <br>
            the roots and the good leaves, the seeds and the crawlers. <br>
            Then a flint pestle to smash, to crush, to grind or break. <br>
            <br>
            And sometimes men chased the beasts <br>
            into the deep woods, <br>
            and never came back. <br>
            <br>
            Some mushrooms will kill you, <br>
            while some will show you gods <br>
            and some will feed the hunger in our bellies. Identify. <br>
            Others will kill us if we eat them raw, <br>
            and kill us again if we cook them once, <br>
            but if we boil them up in spring water, and pour the water away, <br>
            and then boil them once more, and pour the water away, <br>
            only then can we eat them safely. Observe. <br>
            <br>
            Observe childbirth, measure the swell of bellies and the shape of breasts, <br>
            and through experience discover how to bring babies safely into the world. <br>
            <br>
            Observe everything. <br>
            <br>
            And the mushroom hunters walk the ways they walk <br>
            and watch the world, and see what they observe. <br>
            And some of them would thrive and lick their lips, <br>
            While others clutched their stomachs and expired. <br>
            So laws are made and handed down on what is safe. Formulate. <br>
            <br>
            The tools we make to build our lives: <br>
            our clothes, our food, our path home… <br>
            all these things we base on observation, <br>
            on experiment, on measurement, on truth. <br>
            <br>
            And science, you remember, is the study <br>
            of the nature and behaviour of the universe, <br>
            based on observation, experiment, and measurement, <br>
            and the formulation of laws to describe these facts. <br>
            <br>
            The race continues. An early scientist <br>
            drew beasts upon the walls of caves <br>
            to show her children, now all fat on mushrooms <br>
            and on berries, what would be safe to hunt. <br>
            <br>
            The men go running on after beasts. <br>
            <br>
            The scientists walk more slowly, over to the brow of the hill <br>
            and down to the water’s edge and past the place where the red clay runs. <br>
            They are carrying their babies in the slings they made, <br>
            freeing their hands to pick the mushrooms. <br>
