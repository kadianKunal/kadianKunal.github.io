            <br>
            If you’re going to try, go all the way. <br>
            Otherwise, don’t even start. <br>
            <br>
            If you’re going to try, go all the way. <br>
            This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives, jobs <br>
            and maybe even your mind. <br>
            <br>
            Go all the way. <br>
            It could mean not eating for three or four days. <br>
            It could mean freezing on a park bench. <br>
            It could mean jail. <br>
            It could mean derision, mockery, isolation. <br>
            Isolation is the gift. <br>
            All the others are a test of your endurance, <br>
            of how much you really want to do it. <br>
            And, you’ll do it, <br>
            despite rejection and the worst odds. <br>
            And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. <br>
            <br>
            If you’re going to try, <br> 
            go all the way. <br>
            There is no other feeling like that. <br>
            You will be alone with the gods, <br>
            and the nights will flame with fire. <br>
            <br>
            do it. do it. do it. <br>
            do it. <br>
            <br>
            All the way <br>
            All the way. <br>
            <br>
            You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. <br>
            It’s the only good fight there is. <br>
